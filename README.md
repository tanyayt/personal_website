# About 
This repository contains all the files used to build my [GitPage](https://tanyayt.github.io/). The process is well documented in this 
Detailed Walk-through [**Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages**](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). 

# Tips
1.  Create new page: create markdown file and remember to change the permanent link,eg. /resume/
2.  Use Links: Be sure to use permannt links, e.g. `{{ site.baseurl }}/`
