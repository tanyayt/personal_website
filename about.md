I am a data analyst and education researcher. I currently work as a Research Analyst at [Langara College](https://langara.ca/) in [Vancouver, Canada](https://goo.gl/maps/emyJHZGbRyCrxjSJ7). 

I am passionate about improving organizational effectiveness with data-driven insights. I began my career as a science instructor, an educational technology specialist, and now a data analyst in institutional research of higher education. I am looking for opportunities to promote and lead a data-driven culture in higher education and online learning industries.
