Data Analyst ➡️ Data Scientist with💡8+ years of experience as a 🌟data analyst, learning science researcher, and educator | Blog: https://tanyayt.github.io/

I am always interested in understanding intelligence - how we humans develop intelligence and how to train deep learning models to "think" like us. I started my career as an instructor, and explored how to better"encode" knowledge, facilitate long-term memory and learning transfer as a practitioner. Fascinated by the inner workings of cognitive science, I then conducted several scholarly research projects to truly dive deep into understanding learning processes through quantitative and qualitative analysis. ✨ This led me to my current position as a data analyst, turning data into business insights. I take pride in being a lifelong learner. I have earned 14 certificates in technical & business areas, and expect to earn my 2nd masters degree (in Computer Science) in April 2022. 

I look forward to further expanding my experience in data science, particularly in deep learning. I am excited to be part of the community leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and making the world a better place.
