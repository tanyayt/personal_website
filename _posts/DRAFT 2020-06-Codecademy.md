# What I have learned



# What I liked about the program

This program has 26 modules, each of which consists of interactive coding lessons, knowledge quizzes, and projects. Different from the Udacity program I took before, Codecademy seems to primarily uses text and interactive coding schema, instead of videos. For some, this might feel a lack of human touch. But from a course development perspective, Codecamy materials are easier to update.
