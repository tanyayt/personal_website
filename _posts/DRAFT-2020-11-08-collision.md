# Project overview

- The fundamental importance of collision problems
- This project presents a simple yet still effective model to train a robot to avoid collisions using neural networks. More advanced algorithms can be explored, including: recurrent neural network and LSTM.

## Problem Statement 

The goal of this project is to predict collisions based on robot's sensor values. 

## Metric

The metric used will be loss on testing data. 

# Analysis 

## Data Exploration



# Results and Conclusion
