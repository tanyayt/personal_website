I am excited to share my learning experience with Udacity's [Programming for Data Science using Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104). I will talk about my timeline, what I have learned, and personal reflections on lifelong learning.

# Timeline

Before starting the program, I have finished half of the famous book [Automate Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and have had some familiarity with Python. Although I enjoyed reading this book, I am looking for a better-guided learning experience and opportunities to build complex real-world projects. I signed up Udacity with their generous first-month free promotion and successfully completed the 3-month program after 16 days. 

*   Day 0 (2020-04-25): started learning
*   Day 6: completed Unit 1 and 2 Intro to SQL and Project 1: Investigate a relational database
*   Day 10: completed Unit 3 and 4 Command Line Essentials and Intro to Python
*   Day 12: completed Project 2: Bikeshare data
*   Day 16: received the [certificate](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/GFMN9CT3) and officially graduated! 

# What I have learned

*   [Investigate a movie rental database with SQL queries](https://github.com/tanyayt/udacity_prog4ds_using_python/tree/master/movie_rental_sql_project) (including aggregations, sub-queries, window functions)
*   [Build a simple python program](https://github.com/tanyayt/udacity_prog4ds_using_python/tree/master/bikeshare_python_project) with which users interactively explore bikeshare data (using NumPy and Panda libraries)
*   Manage projects using Git and Jupyter Notebook

Although I had already known about SQL, Python, and Git before starting this program, I find it helpful to systematically learn all the fundamentals with this program. This program can well suite learners with zero exposure to SQL and Python .

# What I like about the program

1.  Learning strategies for coding: the course introduces learning strategies, e.g. note-taking, recalling codes (instead of reading codes), spacing out learning sessions, etc. 
2.   Just-enough to get you start coding: beginners are often losing interest in rote memorization of syntax. This program, however, quickly introduces all the fundamental concepts needed to complete your first SQL and Python projects. 
3.  Timely feedback: the [data science program](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) I took before on Coursera uses peer assessments. The quality of feedback depends. I appreciate that Udacity allocates recourses so that actual graders are responsible for giving code reviews, and answering questions in the community forum. I received very helpful feedback within 8 hours. 

# Reflection on lifelong learning

I deeply believe in lifelong learning. The happiness is real when I can achieve something that I have had no idea about before.  In this era of rapid advancement, the only thing that doesn't change is change itself - we either change for the better or the worse. When I put my first hello-world kind of project on GitHub, I did feel somewhat embarrassed since it was like a toddler bragging about the ability to walk. But I also felt proud, proud of making this baby step forward and out of my comfort zone. And so the journey began and will continue. I'll end this post with a quote from Ernest Hemingway: 

>   “True nobility is being superior to your former self.”
