[Mindset: the New Psychology of Success](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset) is written by Stanford psychologies Carol S. Dweck, who discusses how mindsets can affect success in school, work, and life. In summary, a fixed mindset believes intelligence, character, and ability are unchangeable whereas a growth mindset believes the possibility to develop and grow. People with fixed mindsets seek approvals and fear failures; people with growth mindsets learn from criticism and embrace challenges. 

# My Takeaways

-   *Setbacks are not failures. You fail only if you stop trying*: with a fixed mindset, you either succeed or lose. In a growth mindset, success is growth, big or small. There is power in "not yet" - you are just not there, yet. 

    

-   *Praise "becoming" not "being"*: If we praise kids for fixed traits, what if they fail next time? "Am I not smart?" "Am I not a natural?" If success is attributed to "who we are" but not "what we did", we will also attribute failures to "who will never become". So praise wisely, praise the process that kids engage in, their effort, their strategies, their focus, their improvement, their self-discipline and this will help them to develop themselves. More importantly, when they fail, they can still gain confidence and have hopes of success, once they improve the process. 

    

-   *See yourself as a work-in-progress and work on it*: life transformation begins in our mind and only when we believe that we can change, we can start thinking and taking the actions. A growth mindset not only tells us to send the right message to our kids but also the right message to ourselves. Whatever we are not satisfied with now, is temporary, and we can change it for the better with deliberate effort, persistence, and the right strategy. 

Although I completely agree that one should believe in the possibility of attaining success, success is not always attainable in reality. No matter how hard we try, we only have a finite amount of effort and time in one lifetime for trials and errors. It is therefore fundamentally important to choose the right path to pursue based on return on *effort*. The book seems to over-emphasize effortful pursuits, but overlooks the significance of choice. 

# Quotes

-   No matter what your ability is, effort is what ignites that ability and turns it into accomplishment. 
-   If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, and keep on learning. That way, their children don’t have to be slaves of praise. They will have a lifelong way to build and repair their own confidence.
-   Praise should deal, not with the child’s personality attributes, but with his efforts and achievements
-   Real self-confidence is not reflected in a title... it is reflected in your mindset: your readiness to grow
