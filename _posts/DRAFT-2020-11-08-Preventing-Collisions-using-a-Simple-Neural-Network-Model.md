# Project overview

- The fundamental importance of collision problems
- This project presents a simple yet still effective model to train a robot to avoid collisions using neural networks. More advanced algorithms can be explored, including: recurrent neural network and LSTM.

## Problem Statement 

The goal of this project is to predict collisions based on robot's sensor values. 

## Metric

The metric used will be loss on testing data. 

?? false positive?? 

# The Simulated Environment 

gif of robot wandering entirely random

# Neural Network Model



# Results & Conclusion

false positive rate; traing outcomes gif
