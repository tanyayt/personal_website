Airbnb has transformed travel and the vacation rental industry in numerous ways. It provides travelers cost-effective accommodation options beyond traditional hotel rooms, and brings hosts additional income to compensate housing expenses in the city. This project analyzes Airbnb data in Boston area, and provides valuable insights into the availability trend and pricing distribution in different neighborhoods.

Availability is defined as the % of listings available. Availability reaches its highest point in early December 2016, and its lowest point in mid-September 2016. It is unusual to that Sept 2017 doesn't see a low availability as in Sept 2016. Let's examine the total number of available units to see if we see a higher supply in Sept 2017.

Each question is answered with a clear visual, table, or statistic that provides how the data supports or disagrees with some hypothesis that could be formed by each question of interest.
