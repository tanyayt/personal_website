Bike-sharing programs have been growing in popularity around the world as a new convenient, healthy and eco-friendly transporation options in major cities. In this project, I built a simple python program to answer user-defined questions about Bikeshare data in New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC.

Here is how it works:

In a nutshell, you would first select the city you are interested in, and sepecify the month and day of week. The output of the program provides user stats by gender, subscription-status, most common start station, and most common start hours etc.
