# Why Learning Google Analytics 

Google Analytics is the No.1 web analytics tool that is widely used to track and understand users' online behaviors, measure and improve marketng strategies, and drive user and revenue growth online. It automatically resolves the challenges in the data collection side, and provides many high-level reports by default. I think it truly helps analysts to work on analysis itself rather than data engineering. 

That being said, I think it is just the next useful analytics tool to be added to my toolset.
