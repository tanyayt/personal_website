Customer Loyalty program is one of the most widely used marketing strategies to improve customer engagement. Starbucks sends their promotional offers to customers via email, social media channels or to their mobile Apps. It is important to understand customer behaviors in response to these offers to optimize the offer selections for them. In this project, I took a deep dive into Starbucks App data and built a machine learning model to predict whether a user will complete  a promotional offer.
