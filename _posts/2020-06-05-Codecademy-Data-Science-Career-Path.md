# What I have learned

*   Data cleaning analysis with Pandas and NumPy
*   Data visualization with Seaborn
*   Statistical analysis with SciPy
*   Web scraping with beautiful Soup
*   Machine learning with skilearn 
*   Introduction to natural language processing 

# Pros & Cons

**Pros**: each of the 26 modules  in the program consist of interactive coding lessons, knowledge quizzes, and projects. The program covers a broad range of topics from NumPy and Pandas, to advanced data science topics such as natural language processing. The program provides practice packs and cheat sheets for quick review of each module.

**Cons**: it is unreasonable to expect a solid foundation for machine learning from the program. You'll likely end up "knowing-how", not "knowing-why".  Assessment is either self-assessment or peer-assessment, lacking constructive feedback and mentorship. 

# Timeline 

Day 0: started the career path 

Day 4: completed module 6
