A key aspect of agile project is rapid delivery of new features. Each sprint is built on a set of impovements and issue resolutions and the release notes can help the development team, stakeholders and end-users to keep track. 

Here is the thought process I go about in writing release notes: 

## 1. Identify the purpose

* Why do I want to write a release note? 
* Who is the audience? 
* What do I expect the audience to do after reading the release notes? 

Example Answers: 

- To formally inform the release of features in discussions (e.g. I might have initated a discussion with the Data Steward; I then let him/her now the revised data form is deployed in production) 
- To prepare the support team of potential questions that could be asked (new features can also mean new questions or issues reported from the end-users. So the release notes provide necessary context) 
- The release notes is a formal response to feature requests and help elicit more helpful feedback from the end-users and various stakeholders in the organization
- The primary audience is the end users. I hope they glance over the release notes and most importantly to more actively engage with the product

## 2. Create an Engaging Non-Technical Title 

The subject line does NOT have to include "release notes", and in fact, I personally prefer not to use the term in the subject line. In fact, the end-user probably doesn't care about the exact version number etc (p.s. exact version number is important to development teams though)

Some good examples: 

* Say hello to new [your product name here]: you asked, we listened 
* Introducing [your product name here]: a new way to [action verb here]
* [New!] [feature name here] are live - Check out our most requested features!

## 3. Make call to actions easier 

What are some example call to actions: 

- Download the latest app 
- View the longer blog post 
- Log in and try out the feature 

Generally speaking, a clickable button has higher chance of being clicked than a plain text link than no link. 

## 4. Make the body text less boring

A few ways to make your plain text interesting: 

* Add emojis: ‚úÖ üì± üí°üõçÔ∏è 
* Gif demonstrations or even videos 
* Text over background image 

## 5. Putting the Audience at the Center 

Be sure to drop the technical acronyms and focus on what the user can do: 

* You can now do [some new features] 
* We bring you new features A, B and C 
* Read more instructions/tutorials here [A, B, C]
* You can easily do [some revamped features] by just one click 
* You can now use the [new feature] to customize [X]
